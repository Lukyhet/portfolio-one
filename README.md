[View the live project here.] (https://lukyhet.github.io/portfolio-one/)

This is a website designed for an online Yoga academy that offers early morning classes.

Early Bird Yoga is a site that offers the solution for those who love to start the day with a self care type of physical activity like yoga but don´t have much time to do it. Their only alternative is to practice yoga very early in the morning, before the kids wake up, before getting ready for the office or any other demanding routine. Early Bird Yoga offers erly morning one on one online classes for adults, couples and "wake up" yoga classes for kids that don´t want to go to a yoga studio so early in the morning and don´t want to waste time scrolling on Youtube looking for the a good "enough" yoga video. 

<details>

Yoga it´s an ancient practice that helps creating a balance between body, mind and soul through the assanas or yoga positions that work through equilibrium, strenght and flexibility. Yoga contributes to the general well being of the individual, diminishes stress and anxiety, enhances muscular tone and strenght and gives the energy required to start a bussy day. The Early Bird Yoga Site offers weekly and monthly packages of Yoga classes in different styles, depending on the level of the Yogi.

### Features Left to Implement

- I would like to add a gallery with pictures of yoga teachers and students sharing online.

## Testing 

I have thested the responsivness of the website using three methods, the first one being developer tools of google chrome, the second is websites like Am I responsive [Am I responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) the third one using my own mobile phone.

The website has a clean appearance in the different screen sizes mentioned, looking more spacious in ipad and mobile phone sizes due to the media queries height used to fix gaps between the sections.

The most challenging bug to fix were the one in the dropdown menu that consisted in tiny see-through gaps between the elements of the list that seemed disharmonious, to fix these gaps I tried many strategies, being finally fixed with the help of an experienced developer who found the problem interesting and was willing to mentor me to fix the bug, I credit him in the comments.

The second bug that I found very challenging was to get rid of the massive space below the hero image, and then below the about us section, apparently caused by the small png. Image of the man doing yoga and later by the height of the about us section. 

In the process of fixing these bugs I did a lot of research finding many options and learning in the process how delicate is the CSS cascade system.

### Validator Testing and Unfixed Bugs.

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### 

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits 

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
