# Intorduction Early Bird Online Yoga


[View the live project here.] (https://lukyhet.github.io/portfolio-one/)

This is a website designed for an online Yoga academy that offers early morning classes.

Early Bird Yoga is a site that offers the solution for those who love to start the day with a self care type of physical activity like yoga but don´t have much time to do it. Their only alternative is to practice yoga very early in the morning, before the kids wake up, before getting ready for the office or any other demanding routine. Early Bird Yoga offers erly morning one on one online classes for adults, couples and "wake up" yoga classes for kids that don´t want to go to a yoga studio so early in the morning and don´t want to waste time scrolling on Youtube looking for the a good "enough" yoga video. 

<details>

Yoga it´s an ancient practice that helps creating a balance between body, mind and soul through the assanas or yoga positions that work through equilibrium, strenght and flexibility. Yoga contributes to the general well being of the individual, diminishes stress and anxiety, enhances muscular tone and strenght and gives the energy required to start a bussy day. The Early Bird Yoga Site offers weekly and monthly packages of Yoga classes in different styles, depending on the level of the Yogi.


## Features 

This is a one page website with a menu or navigation bar that directs the user to the four different sections in the page.

the four sections are easily identifiable by the contrast of the background and the subtitles. The website has several features. These features are:


### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on the top of the page, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the  Home, About Us, What we Offer, Sign up and Contact sections.

  -The navigation bar works as a dropdown menu in smaller screens making a transition for responsive design.

  - The home includes a big photograph to create a welcoming and inviting environment for the user interested in early online yoga classes. This picture dictates the color palette of the website.

  - This section introduces the user to the website with an eye catching photograph.

  __The Color Palette _

  - The color scheme was inspired by the colors of the hero image and to catch them wih precition a sepcific website was used [IMAGECOLORPICKER.com](https://imagecolorpicker.com/), selecting only three colors that were used along the website, two hues of blue and one of pink to create a clean harmonious environment for the user.
  
  - This section introduces the user to the website with an eye catching photograph.

### Features Left to Implement

- I would like to add a gallery with pictures of yoga teachers and students sharing online and more movement to the website, perhaps other pages added.


## Testing 

I have thested the responsivness of the website using three methods, the first one being developer tools of google chrome, the second is websites like Am I responsive [Am I responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) the third one using my own mobile phone.

The website has a clean appearance in the different screen sizes mentioned, looking more spacious in ipad and mobile phone sizes due to the media queries height used to fix gaps between the sections.

The most challenging bug to fix were the one in the dropdown menu that consisted in tiny see-through gaps between the elements of the list that seemed disharmonious, to fix these gaps I tried many strategies, being finally fixed with the help of an experienced developer who found the problem interesting and was willing to mentor me to fix the bug, I credit him in the comments.

The second bug that I found very challenging was to get rid of the massive space below the hero image, and then below the about us section, apparently caused by the small png. Image of the man doing yoga and later by the height of the about us section. 

In the process of fixing these bugs I did a lot of research finding many options and learning in the process how delicate is the CSS cascade system.

### Validator Testing and Unfixed Bugs.

- HTML
  - Error: Bad value 100% for attribute width on element iframe: Expected a digit but saw % instead.

          <iframe↩                src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2003.664006973069!2d17.64…2ce346298!2sKungsgatan%2083%2C%20753%2041%20Uppsala!5e0!3m2!1ses!2sse!4v1634312688796!5m2!1ses!2sse"↩                width="100%" height="300" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy"></ifra

- CSS

- Resultados del Validador CSS del W3C para https://lukyhet.github.io/portfolio-one/ (CSS versión 3 + SVG)
¡Enhorabuena! No error encontrado.
¡Este documento es CSS versión 3 + SVG válido! 

The results are given in spanish to me because the browser is detecting the main language used but they.
### 

-The only error detected by the html validator was fixed by changing the porperty width="100%" to style="width:100%" but the validator keeps showing the same mistake even though the property witdh="100%" does not exist in the html code of the website. I keep working on it, perhaps a cache issue.

## Deployment

  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
